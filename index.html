            <h1>What is cryptocurrency?</h1>
            <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as
                a
                medium
                of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database
                using
                strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to
                verify
                the transfer of coin ownership. Cryptocurrencies are generally fiat currencies, as they are not backed
                by or
                convertible into a commodity.Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a
                proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the
                token
                in
                proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the
                token
                over
                time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.
                
                Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a
                central
                authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital
                currency
                (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is
                generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works
                through
                distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction
                database.
                
                A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology
                that
                only
                exists online. Cryptocurrencies use encryption to authenticate and protect transactions, hence their
                name.
                There
                are currently over a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world, and many see them as the key to a
                fairer
                future economy.

            <h2>Why cryptocurrency is important?</h2>
            <p>First, note there are various types of cryptocurrencies, and for the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus
                on
                easily
                the most mentioned and used: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
                
                Bitcoin was the very first blockchain – a financial one – created by an individual (or group, who knows)
                called
                Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Its value has exponentially increased to a ridiculous level: you may have seen
                pieces
                swirling around the Internet such as “if I had brought $100 of bitcoin back in 2010, I’d have over
                US$100
                million now” or about Bitcoin’s first billionaires. An increasing number of retailers and internet
                sellers
                are
                beginning to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.
                
                Without going into too much detail, while Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin, its uses extend beyond
                the
                mere
                financial side of things such as mining, into the provision of services on its own particular
                blockchain.
                Ethereum provides built-in software programming languages which can be used to write, for example, smart
                contracts that can be used for many purposes, including the transfer and mining of its own tradeable
                digital
                token, Ether (which is even more complex than Bitcoin).
                
                Prior to Christmas 2017, the cryptocurrency space went through a process called “mooning”1. That is to
                say,
                their prices went utterly and completely ridiculously sky high. It became the absolutely wrong time to
                buy
                crypto. Because just before Christmas, the entire market utterly crashed, losing approximately 20% of
                its
                entire
                global market cap.
                
                It then bounced up. And then in mid-January, crypto exchanges again crashed, with prices in Ethereum for
                instance falling approximately 25%.
                


                So, the headlines. Regulators issuing “buyer beware” notices (certainly needed, but also because many
                central
                regulators struggle with the notion of regulating a decentralised technology). Investing in initial coin
                offerings (ICO’s) and in cryptocurrencies is highly speculative and basically you can lose all your
                money.
                
                And you can indeed. Of course, you can say the public shareholders of Lehman Brothers also did, but
                unquestionably cryptocurrency exchanges are far more volatile than the stock markets.
                
                But cryptocurrency is important and it is not going away, or be limited to 100 years as others may
                speculate:
                transactions are fast, digital, secure and worldwide, which in essence allow the maintenance of records
                without
                risk of data being pirated. Fraud is, actually, minimized.
                
                Also, as an aside, digital currency such as Bitcoin should not result in inflation. The total number of
                bitcoins
                which can ever be mined is limited to approximately 21 million, so there is no way the total amount of
                cash
                in
                the system can be increased by any central bank. Bitcoin itself is, by its nature, scarce… though one
                can
                certainly argue that cryptocurrencies themselves, are infinite as they can be generated by anyone.
